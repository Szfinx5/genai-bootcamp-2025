## Output
I'll help you translate this sentence to Tagalog! Let's break it down step by step.    
                             
#### First, here's the relevant vocabulary:       
              
|English        |Tagalog    |Notes      |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
|nice/beautiful |maganda    |adjective  |
|sun/sunny      |araw       |noun       |
|day            |araw(yes, same word!)  |
           
#### Key points about sentence structure:

    -   Tagalog often uses the pattern: [Adjective] + [Subject]                   
    -   We can use "napaka-" prefix to emphasize "very" or "such"                   
    -   When describing weather/day, we often start with "Ang" (the)                      
                            
Can you try constructing the sentence with these clues? Here's a hint: you'll need to combine "napaka" with "maganda" to express "such nice."       
What do you think comes first in the sentence?Â 

```
napaka maganda araw ang awar
```

You're very close! Let me help you refine this.        
A few corrections needed:             
                
    -   When using "napaka-" with "maganda", they combine into one word            
    -   Since "araw" appears twice (for both sun and day), we only need to use it once               
    -   "Ang" typically comes at the beginning of the sentence           
                    
So let's fix your attempt:                
             
    -   "napaka maganda" should be "napakaganda"              
    -   We can simplify the double "araw"                                
    -   "Ang" should move to the front                     
                                  
Would you like to try again with these corrections? Remember the pattern:                         
[Ang] + [napakaganda] + [ng] + [araw]                          
(Note: "ng" is a linking particle we use between descriptions and nouns)Â 

```
Ang napakaganda ng araw
```

Perfect! ðŸŒž That's exactly right - "Ang napakaganda ng araw"!              
#### Let's break down why this is correct:                                          
                          
"Ang" - begins the sentence as a marker                                     
"napakaganda" - combines "napaka" (such/very) + "ganda" (beauty/nice)                                          
"ng" - linking particle                                            
"araw" - means both sun and day                                                         
                     
Your sentence literally translates to "The very beautiful day" but carries the same meaning as "Such a nice sunny day" in English.      
Would you like to try another sentence? We can work with different adjectives or perhaps a more complex sentence structure!                                       
     
## Score
#### 8/10 
    - Gave away teh answer even if the instruction asked not to do that.
    - A bit unusual way of saying a simple sentence, not bad but not how the locals would use the language
