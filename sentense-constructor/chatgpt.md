### Sentence Structure:
In Tagalog, the subject usually comes first, followed by the predicate. For a descriptive sentence like this, you can structure it as:

Subject + Predicate

You might want to try putting those words together!

Hints:
```
"Such" can be translated as "ganitong," and it comes before "nice."
"Sunny day" will be a combination of "maaraw" (sunny) and "araw" (day).

You're close! You almost have it right, but let's adjust a bit.                           
                              
"Maalinsangan" refers to "humid" or "stuffy," which isn’t quite the right word for "sunny."             
"Maaraw" is the correct word for "sunny," which describes the weather.                     
So, the corrected sentence should be:                     
          
Ganitong magandang maaraw na araw.                
                                                   
Here’s the breakdown:                   
                           
Ganitong = such (emphasizing the quality of the day)                   
Magandang = nice (in its proper form, as "maganda" needs to be in its "magandang" form before a noun)                 
Maaraw = sunny                              
Na araw = the word "na" is used to link the descriptive adjective (maaraw) to the noun (araw).                   
Great effort! Now you try again!

Perfect! You've nailed it!                           
                                                
Ganitong magandang maaraw na araw is the correct translation for "Such a nice sunny day."
