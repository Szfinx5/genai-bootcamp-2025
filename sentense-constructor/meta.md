Vocabulary Table:

| English Word	| Tagalog Word (Dictionary Form)|
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Nice	        | Maganda                       |
| Sunny	        | Maalinsol (or) Marahang araw  |
| Day	        | Araw                          |

#### Possible Sentence Structure

To describe the weather in Tagalog, you can use the following sentence structure:     
"[Adjective] [noun]"     
In this case, you can describe the day as "nice" and "sunny."     
Clue     
Start by combining the Tagalog words for "nice" and "sunny" to describe the day. Then, add the word for "day" to complete the sentence.     
Your turn! Try to construct the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.     
```
Maganda maalinsol araw?
```
Malapit ka na! (You're close!)             
Your sentence, "Maganda maalinsol araw," is almost correct. However, in Tagalog, we typically use a specific word to connect the adjectives "maganda" (nice) and "maalinsol" (sunny) to the noun "araw" (day).            
#### Additional Vocabulary               
|English Word   | Tagalog Word  |  
|---------------|---------------|        
|And	        | At            |

#### Revised Sentence Structure        
Try using the word "at" to connect the adjectives:       
"Maganda at maalinsol na araw."           
Notice the additional word "na" before "araw." This is a linker that helps connect the adjectives to the noun.           
Give it another try!  
```          
Maganda at maalinsol na araw
```
Mabuti! (Good job!) Your revised sentence, "Maganda at maalinsol na araw," is now grammatically correct and accurately conveys the meaning of "Such a nice sunny day."                 
You successfully used the vocabulary and sentence structure provided to construct a coherent Tagalog sentence. Keep up the good work!
